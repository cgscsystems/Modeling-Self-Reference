## Naming Convention

Files follow the pattern: `{from}-{to}_{topic}.md`

- **Participants**: Use initials (WH, MM, RQ, etc.)
- **Topic**: Brief kebab-case descriptor
- **Date**: Included in document metadata, not filename

Examples:
- `wh-mm_on-pr.md` - WH to MM, regarding PR
- `wh-rq_theory-review.md` - WH to RQ, theory review
- `team_meeting-notes-2026-01-15.md` - Multi-party meeting notes

---

## What Belongs Here

**Include**:
- Significant feedback on PRs, commits, or milestones
- Strategic discussions (IP, collaboration structure, publication plans)
- Q&A exchanges that clarify project direction or theory interpretation
- Meeting notes with actionable outcomes

**Exclude**:
- Routine logistics ("I'll be offline tomorrow")
- Debugging transcripts (put in relevant `session-log.md` instead)
- LLM-only session work (that goes in `llm-facing-documentation/`)
