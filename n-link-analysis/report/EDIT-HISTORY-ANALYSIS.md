## Implications for Basin Stability

Pages with high edit activity may cause basin reorganization if:
1. The N-th link position changes (link inserted/deleted before position N)
2. Link target changes (text replacement affects anchor)
3. Paragraph restructuring moves links across positions

**Recommendation**: Re-extract affected pages after major edits to track basin drift.
