## Notes

- This directory documents the system that documents the project (meta-level)
- Load selectively: implementation.md for architecture, session-log.md for design rationale
- writing-guide.md is Tier 3 (reference only when writing new docs)
- These files should follow their own documented principles (self-referential requirement)
